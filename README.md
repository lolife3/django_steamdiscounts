# django_steamdiscounts

Welcome to my first django project!

The app displays (out of date!) steam discounts. 
The data comes from my "selenium steamdb scrapper" and is imported to mysql database from csv.
- /discounts        - render database table as django "Discounts" model, comes with a functional search form.
- /api              - show API root view
